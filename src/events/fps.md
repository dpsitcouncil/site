  Valorant


  * There are going to maximum of 16 teams with 5 members each.(Coaches are allowed-1)\

  * There aren’t any gun or agent exclusions, everything will work as a normal competitive game.\

  * Both teams will be asked what map they want, if it coincides, that will be played, if not, it’ll be decided by a random generator.

  * There will be an online coin toss between the two teams, which will decide who attacks/defends first.

  * If the game goes into overtime, it will be played until round 20. If it extends, we will ask you to play a spike rush game, which decides the winner.

  * Each team will be given strategic time-outs if necessary. They can only be availed at the start of a round (During the buy-phase). The time-outs can be availed once during attacking and defending.

  * If a teammate disconnects during the middle of a round, we’ll be giving a technical time-out during the next round’s buy phase. This also can be availed only twice.

  * The bracket will be formed in such a way that each team has only one-shot, and there will be no losers bracket.

  * No BM will be tolerated. The moderators of valorant will be overseeing every match. Participants will be disqualified if hate speech, religious, racist terms are used in game chat. No toxicity is allowed.

  * In-case of a server crash, the respective round will be re-started.

  * The moderators will oversee the gameplay, if blatant cheating is observed, or there is proof. Depending upon the severity of the situation the cheating player will be banned from the tournament or the team will instantly be disqualified.

  * The form will be asking your rank, and your team-mates valorant ID. Only the team’s IGL has to submit the form, and write the other team-mates RIOT-ID. They must not change it during the tournament.

  * They also have to submit their Discord-ID (One member each team is enough which will be IGL).

  * The Discord will consist of the tournament schedule, the rules. There will be multiple channels and VC’s, teams can scrim if they wish to before the tournament.

  * If a participant wants to enter alone, depending upon the teams, we’ll be putting you in a random team to fill it out.
