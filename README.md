# IT Council Website

## What is the IT Council?

The IT Council is a student council at DPS Bangalore South that aims to develop an interest in technology and to help create a gradual learning curve for our fellow students, and to build a tech-loving community. As a student council, we run various extracurricular activities like coding jams, tech magazines, hackathons, security-related and many more events. 

## How was it built?

The IT Council website uses HTML, SASS and JS. We use various libraries for effects like [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap/), [particles.JS](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/)
